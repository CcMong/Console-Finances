# Console-Finances

## Description  

The objective of this project was to create code to analyse the financial records of a company over an approximate seven year period, from January 2010 to February 2017. The financial dataset was provided as an array consisting of nested arrays with two fields: Date and Profit/Loss values.  
  

The project was carried out using JavaScript code which analysed the records to determine each of the following:


- The total number of months included in the dataset;


- The net total amount of Profits/Losses over the entire period;


- The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

- The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

## Installation
